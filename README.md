# PHP-Reflection
A PHP website for practicing my web development skills.

I will be creating a pokémon themed website that will pull from an API. You will be able to login and select your favourite pokémon. All of your information will be saved to a database. I will also add more functionality once the core features are complete.

## Core Features 
* Register and Login.
  * Securely encrypted and saved to a database.
  * Utilizing JWT to save your session info to a cookie.
  * An admin account that can change any users information.
* View pokémon information.
  * Information pulled from an api.
  * Images pulled from an image server with the api info.
  * Display that info in a nice html card format.
* Favourite your selected pokémon.
  * This will add an entry to a database.
  * View and edit your favourite pokémon from your user page.
  
  
## Additional Features
* Pokémon ranking
  * Each pokémon favourited will be totalled and a ranking displayed on homepage.
  * Should dynamically update.
